Bandejao is a project that eases the the visualization of the menu of several university's cafeterias.

This app brings all the universities registered in our system and has these features:
★ Completely free and without annoying ads. This app shows that there is free lunch indeed.
★ Don't waste your precious bandwidth because the app communicates only with our servers.
★ You're notified in the moment that we notice a modification in the website that has the menu.
★ Offline. Download the menu when you have Internet and then view it whenever you want.
